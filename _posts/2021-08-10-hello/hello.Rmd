# The Big Bad Math Monster

  As I begin my Master's in Environmental Data Science, I am both relieved and somewhat surprised to find that something like 23 of my 25 classmates are just as out of practice (read: afraid) of the amount of math we will need to recall from the dusty annals of high school as I am. I haven't taken calculus in something like 7 years, and personally I never saw much similarity between calculus and riding a bike.
  Add to this the fact that the MEDS intensive summer program aims to teach a 2 credit course covering all the basics of math required for our degree in the span of 5 days, including all of calculus in 1.5 days, and everyone but the mathlete lifers will understand my trepidation.
  
# R to the Rescue

  My saving grace during the time-warp of numbers and variables that was last week was the fact that I am, despite all appearances, not actually here to learn math. Instead, I am learning `Data Science`, which is a fancy way of saying that I get a computer to do all the scary math for me.
  A smattering of experience in R from my time as an undergrad at Tufts University has been just enough to keep me abreast of the tsunami of information that will continue to be my summer. Though I am gaining familiarity with Python, most of our time in class is spent in RStudio learning how (in my eyes) to return to my blissful math-free youth while inexplicably pursuing a career in Data Science. And that brings us to the `ode()` function in the `deSolve` package.
