Today I combine my love of nature and data science in my role as Ecological Data Specilist at the Great Basin Institute as a contractor for the Bureau of Land Management Montana State Office. In my day-to-day work I get to:
<ul>
<li>Summarize and analyze diverse botanical, ecological, wildlife, and soils data in Python, R, and ArcGIS Pro/Online </li>
<li>Integrate Remote Sensing data with in-situ data using tools like Google Earth Engine and the <a href='https://rangelands.app/'>Rangeland Analysis Platform (RAP)</a></li>
<li>Do Endless Quality Control! AIM is a long-running national protocol with new data constantly entering our databases which must meet strict federal requirements, which means constant communication with data collectors and keeping detailed records of all modifications</li>
</ul>
Building off my time as a Data Management Fellow with the <a href='https://edirepository.org/'>Environmental Data Initiative</a> developing workflows to preserve and disseminate data from watersheds damaged by mine runoff and agriculture, I also strive to ensure that programatic analysis and reporting (using Quarto, RMarkdown, Jupyter Notebooks, and Google Collab) are available to as many of my coworkers as possible, regardless of coding ability.  

If any of my projects or work sound interesting, or you think my skills would be of help on a project of yours, reach out! I am always looking for new environments in which to apply my passion for open science, FAIR data, and inclusivity in data science.
